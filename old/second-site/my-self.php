<p>Hi,</p>
 <p style="line-height:25px;">This is Balan, from Swamithoppu, a remote village far away from the town, where Computer has not flourished and shown it's greatest heights. I did my schooling at Gnana Deepam Matric. School, <!--really hate Mathematics not only in my school daysâ€¦.<img src="images/wink-bw.png" width="20" height="20" align="absmiddle" />--> In 1997, I got the first opportunity to use computers at my school. At that time computer was not that much comforting me because I was unable to do the BASIC programs as my computer master orders me to do. But later, after getting opportunity to use Windows 95, I found myself to be devoted towards computer. I longed and desired to have a personal PC. In 2001, I am so blessed to have my own PC through my ever loving Mom. Since I am the only child for my parent, Computer has become a irreplaceable companion to me. I started learning Visual Basic , Since it was in my higher secondary syllabus, later I started hacking Windows API and started Developing my own softwares. After Schooling, I just completed my Diploma, I strengthened myself by doing some softwares successfully. Then did my Engineering at Cape Institute of Technology. My college, in particular my department HOD overwhelmed me with more opportunities to expose my technical stuff in front of all. Out of my personal interest, I learnt many stuffs like Flash, Photoshop, and also extended my knowledge towards open source softwares Website Development. We as a team participated in Empower IT. After completing my graduation, immediately I got placed in Cape Consultancy Services Pvt Ltd. </p>
